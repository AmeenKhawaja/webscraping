# Analysis
There's always an on going discussion by many people on what year(s) an NBA player hits their prime. 
Obviously, the age when one NBA player is in their prime differs from when another player hits their peak. Genetics, metabolism, training, current and past injuries, and mental attitude play key roles in when each NBA player peaks. Researchers say the age an NBA player hits their prime is between 24 and 31 years old.
<p>
I will be comparing the ages of Lebron James and James Harden vs points scored per game (PTS), assist per game (AST), and minutes played per game (MP). My hypothesis is as the player gets older, they will score fewer points/assists and have fewer minutes played. I estimate a player's prime to be at ages 24-28.

# Results

  - Age vs Points Scored Per Game
    - While Lebron was between 21 and 28 years old, he maintained a consistent 26 to 30 points per game. From 28 to 35 years old, we can see that he is beginning to score less points per games and is on a downwards trend. 
    - For Harden, he seems to have entered his prime at age 27 till age 29. During this time frame, he scored a consistent 28 to 36 points per game.
    - Evidently, Lebron's prime was throughout his 20's while Harden's prime was in his late 20's.
    - Both have a similar correlation, as they continue to age, the amount of points per game begin to decrease.
  - Age vs Minutes Played Per Game
    - From ages 19 to 21, Lebron averaged 40 minutes played per game. In his late twenties Lebron is averaging 10 minutes less played per game.
    - For Harden, during ages 23-27 he maintained his all time high minutes played per game at an average of 38 minutes played per game. As Harden ages, his minutes played per game are decreasing aswell.
  - Age vs Assist Per Game
    - As Lebron ages, his assists per game are at an average of 9 have significantly increased in his early thirties.
    - Harden has also had this trend, as he is aging, his assist per game has continued to incrase at 10
    - My theory is that while a player becomes older, they can no longer play offensive only due to physical limitations and as a result become more of a team player.
 # Final Conclusion
  - NBA players reach their prime in their mid twenties.
  - They average 20% less minutes played per game in their thirties compared to their mid twenties
  - As they age and can no longer score as they once could in their prime, they begin to become a more team oriented player and as a result have an all time high number of assists the older they get
